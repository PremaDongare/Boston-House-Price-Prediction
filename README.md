# 🏡 Boston House Price Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, property tax, and more. The dataset originally comes from the [StatLib library](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston), but due to ethical issues, it is no longer included in scikit-learn by default.

How to run the code
--------------------------
*. Clone the Repo
1. conda create -p ./venv python=3.7 -y
2. conda init cmd.exe
3. conda activate ./venv
4. pip install -r requirements.txt
5. python app.py

🧪 Model Training
The regression model (regmodel.pkl) and the scaler (scaler.pkl) are generated by training on the Boston Housing dataset inside the Jupyter notebook (Boston House Price.ipynb).
